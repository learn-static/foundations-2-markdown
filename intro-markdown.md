# Introduction to Markdown

(from Foundational Learning Modules google doc):
- Copy Template Repository
- Activate GH Pages
- Create index.md
- Create headings, bold/italic, lists, etc.
- Commit changes
- View changes rendered on GH pages

## Activate GitHub Pages

1. On your project repository's home page, click the "Settings" button (appears on the right along the tabs above the code area).
2. On "Settings" page: click "Pages" in the left side menu.
3. On the "Pages" page: in the "Source" section, change the dropdown button from "none" to "main" (leave the folder option as "/root"), then click the "Save" button. 

Once saved, the page will refresh with an alert providing the URL where your site will appear. 
It will take a few minutes for the build to happen and your site to go live--so wait it out! 

Meanwhile, you might want to copy the URL to display on your home page:

1. Copy the provided URL.
2. Go to repository's home page.
3. On right side of the code area, look for "About" section and click on the cog icon to edit. 
4. In the "About" box, paste in your URL, then click "Save". This will make it easy to access the site in the future!
