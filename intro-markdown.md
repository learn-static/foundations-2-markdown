# Introduction to Markdown
This brief module provides instructions that give newcomers experience using Markdown, a markup language for adding formatting elements to plain text files. You can think of this module supporting your work by teaching you how to laydown the structural bones of a website. Before we begin using Markdown, let's clarify what is Markdown and give it context.

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax that helps to make writing for the Internet easier. It allows for a straight-forward way to structure text, links, images, code, tables, and lists within a plain text document without using tags like those used to markup plain text documents with HTML.

**Why use Markdown?**
1. It can be fast to use while writing web page content
2. It is used all over the place. It's a standard used by GitHub and other tools people use reguarly to communicate over the Internet.
3. It converts easily to HTML
4. It is future-friendly. This means Markdown within a plain text file that has the file extension `.md` can be opened and used by any current day or future computer program. There is no reason to worry about outdated verisons of your plain text files.

# Let's make a Markdown file using GitHub

## Create `index.md` within a GitHub repository
Before we can add Markdown to a plain text file, we need to make one within GitHub.

1. Create a new repository or use one that you've already made while working through [foundations-0-github](https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-0-github).
2. Once you are in the repository, click Add file and then Create new file.

3. Type `index.md` into the box that is to the right of foundations-2-markdown. In your example the repository name will be whatever your titled it. Also, by taking this step you will have produced a Markdown text file.

4. Navigate to Commit new file. It is at the bottom of the page.
5. Within the second input box that says "Add an optional extended description..." add a description about what you just did. If you are not sure how to make a commit, visit [foundations-0-github](https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-0-github) for instructions.

6. Click Commit new file
7. After you have made your commit then you will be on your repository's home page. You should now see `index.md` in your list of files

## Open `index.md` to begin writing with Markdown
1. Click `index.md` to open it.

2. Click the pencil icon to edit `index.md`

3. You are now in edit mode and can begin writing.

# Let's write using Markdown

When writing on the Internet with Markdown, we use it's synax to format text in structured ways using...

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Line Breaks
- Emphasis, e.g. bold and italics
- Lists, e.g. numbered lists and unordered lists
- Images
- Hyperlinks
- Blockquotes
- Tables

For this learning exercise, we will learn how to use headings, paragraphs, line breaks, emphasis, lists, images, and hyperlinks. To learn how to use other parts of the Markdown syntax visit [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Adding Headings
Markdown uses `#` to give structure to a web page's layout, and there are different heading levels to use while writing. Headings are organized in a hierarchical order that create sections on a web page. You must not breaking this order because it will make the readability of your web page content visuall difficult to read, and will have negative impact on the readability, navigation, and accessibility of your web page. To learn more about headings and web accessibility visit [A11y styleguide - Structure](https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/section-structure.html)

```# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
```

Now lets apply this to the `index.md` that you previously made.

1. Get into `index.md` edit mode
2. Add two headings using this code -- heading 1 and heading 2. You are welcome to use whatever text you like, but example text is available here.

Here are two examples that show Markdown in code form and then what Markdown looks like on a web page.

Markdown Example
```
# Y≈çkai Senjafuda: Stories about Ghosts and Monsters
## Senjafuda collections at the University of Oregon
```

Markdown Rendering Example

You will need to write in Markdown using the Edit file box. This example image shows where you would start writing in Markdown.

3. Click the Preview tab that is to the right of the Edit File tab. This will allow you to see how your headings will render on a web page.
